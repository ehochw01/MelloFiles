Music Rating App

This is a music rating app where a user can search an artists name, and see rating and review data for their albums. 
The album and artist data are obtained using the Spotify Web Api.
Users have the option of logging in. If they are logged in, they can leave a rating or review.
They also of the option of using the site without a login where they can see Average User ratings for albums as well as existing user reviews.
The home page renders news releases from spotify's api to inform the user about new released music.
If the user wants to see or leave ratings and reviews, they have to search for an artist in the search bar which brings them to the artist page.
The artist page has all of an artist's albums from spotify, and the average reviews for that album in our database.
A user can then click on one of the albums and go to the artist page where they can read other users' reviews for that album, and leave their own if they are logged in.
